# SportsStats
A python application and Postgres database to retrieve team statistics for the NHL, NBA, and MLB. 

## Tables and Fields
Tables are Leagues, Teams, Seasons, and Standings. Fields and relationships are outlined as per the ERD below.

## Resources
Data was sourced from the following APIs and python wrappers:

- **MLB:** MLB data was retrieved from the [MLB-StatsAPI Python Wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/MLB-StatsAPI/). Data for the Seasons table with dates for the regular season, spring training, and postseason was retrieved from the `statsapi.get('seasons')` function. Data for the Leagues, Teams, and Standings tables was retrieved from `statsapi.standings_data` function. 

- **NBA:** NBA data for the Leagues, Teams, and Standings tables was retrieved from the [NBA API](https://github.com/swar/nba_api/blob/master/docs/nba_api/stats/endpoints/leaguestandings.md) Admittedly, finding the correct headers to get this API to work was a challenge. Data for the Seasons table was added manually, and is something I would change in the future.

- **NHL:** NHL data for the Seasons, and Leagues tables was retrieved from the [NHL API](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference?tab=readme-ov-file#nhl-stats-api-documentation) using the `https://api.nhle.com/stats/rest/season` endpoint . Data for the Teams and Standings table was retrieved from the [Sports Radar API](https://developer.sportradar.com/ice-hockey/reference/nhl-overview).

## Next Steps
As I continue to develop this repository, I want to implement several changes to ensure the code remains functional, maintainable, and capable of retrieving and processing data consistently and reproducibly. Below are some initial areas of focus:

- NBA Seasons: The seasonal dates were manually added, so I plan to review the API and its documentation to identify opportunities for automating the retrieval of seasonal date data. This will help ensure accuracy and reduce manual interferance.

- NHL Standings and Teams Tables: Currently, standings data is retrieved indirectly through Sports Radar. I will evaluate the NHL API to determine whether it provides a direct and more efficient method for accessing this data, potentially improving both performance and reliability.

- Code Standardization and Cleaning: I plan to refactor the codebase to improve standardization and maintainability. Specifically,  I want to ensure that functions within each class follow consistent design principles and operate on uniform data structures. For better organization, I will introduce a high-level dictionary structure at the top of each repective class to store key datasets for `league_data`, `seasons_data`, `teams_data`, and `standings_data`. These dictionaries will include nested dictionaries for each league. Overall, my goal is to enhance code readability and scalability while keeping in mind object-oriented programming best practices.
